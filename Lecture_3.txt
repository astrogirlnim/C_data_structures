      Highlits of the lecture: floats, ints, macros, integer manipulation

1. Mantissa bits: bits of a float after the decimal point
	float representation
	1 sign bit
	8 exponent bits
	23 mantissa bits
	
	ShowFloat(0.1) --> shows a float, more accuracy
		first number in rows with sets of 3 --> sign bit (then exponent bits, then mantissa bits)
	accuracy is limited
	Show(1/3) --> int version, rounds, not super accurate
2. Integer arithmetic and bad float creation
	float badonethird = 1 / 3; RHS is int, gets 0 --> 0.0
	better to do 1 / 3.0
	Explicit conversion
		"cast" --> ShowFloat(((float) 1)/3); --> explicitly casting type 
			int x = 5; 
			(float) x / 3 --> converts to an int explicitly 
	Better to take default type conversions instead of casting
3. Issues with floats
	roundoff error --> can accummulate 
	using double may help with rounding error, 64 bit float, more exponent and mantissa bits 
		double doubleinversedenominator = 1.0 / denominator;
		print("%g\n", doubleinversedenominator);
